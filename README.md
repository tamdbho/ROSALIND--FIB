Rabbits and Recurrence Relations

The Fibonacci sequence appears throughout the natural world, and it dates back over two millennia to its first use by Indian mathematicians; yet its name derives from Leonardo of Pisa, who popularized the sequence in the West by introducing it as an exercise involving a population of rabbits in 1202. His assumption about the population were as follows:

The population begins in the first month with a pair of newborn rabbits:
- Rabbits reach reproductive age in one month.
- In any month, every rabbit of reproductive age mates with another rabbit of reproductive age.
- One month after two rabbits have mated, the female rabbit gives birth to a male and female rabbit.
- Rabbits never stop reproducing or die.

Given: Positive integers n≤40 and k≤5

Return: The total number of rabbit pairs that will be present after n months, if we begin with 1 pair and in each generation, every pair of reproduction-age rabbits produces a litter of k rabbit pairs (instead of only 1 pair).
